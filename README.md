-Sometimes, power brings corruption, and it could even happen in the academic environment. Students are the victims of it as they are the weakest members of the organizations. On the other hand, higher-ranked members, like advisors and co-advisors, are powerful and can influence other members of the community through their power and position, regardless of their claim's validity. This scenario could even happen in modern countries, especially if the student is from third-world countries like the Middle East or Africa. In this situation, if the student is not obedient enough or wants to show his/her true scientific potential, they face unfair behavior or misconduct by their advisors and co-advisors. In this condition, the advisor and co-advisor abuse their power to label the student with false documents and force the student to accept terms in a long duration of humiliation or court meeting, which destroys the student mentally and psychologically. After a long time of pressure, the student will accept any terms and conditions under pressure that are not correct. If the student is overqualified and the higher rank is psychologically unstable, there is a high possibility of envy and more pressure as they feel secure from any action due to their position. Here, the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through Ethical AI could be handy in monitoring this unfairness in the university/organization and revealing what exactly is happening. Also, this could affect other academic members, who assist the corrupt advisor and the co-advisor.

- Sometimes, students' breakthrough achievements will be ignored or will be rejected without any clear reason, which could be devastating for the student. This happens due to a low level of obedience of the student to their will, which sometimes could be expressed implicitly over time. So, here we are not talking about achievements but other demands which students are not willing to do.
    
- Another reason for such behavior is the lack of knowledge of the advisor in that specific area. For instance, the advisor accepts the student in the interview, but she/he doesn't have enough knowledge in the area of the advertised project. She/he has to assign another person to handle the new student. Now, this person could be a post-doc student with limited knowledge or time. Over time, the advisor found out that things were not working well as the co-advisor was busy with his/her projects, and the advisor her/himself is not familiar with the topic. So, there is no choice but to show the student's lack of achievement to the committee rather than accepting the reality as it would be very destructive for her/his reputation. Again, the advisor has to abuse power, as mentioned above.

- These types of actions could be devastating for the future of the student as the student considers this advisor to be a sample of that nation and also finds it difficult to trust people in the future, especially people with the same background.

- Another reason for such a phenomenon is the similarity between students' high scientific level and the advisor's advisor during her/his PhD. In this case, the corrupted advisor abuses the power to get revenge from a similar person but from an innocent individual.
